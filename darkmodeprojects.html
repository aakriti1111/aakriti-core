    <h2>Game of Pigs </h2>
    <h3> Language: C++, Operating System: Windows, Course: CMPT130</h3>
    <p>Using starter code with predefined function declarations and test cases, I developed a fully functional console-based Game of Pigs in C++. This was my first project and marked my introduction to game development. I carefully defined each function and implemented additional helper functions to enhance functionality and ensure an optimized user experience. The game was designed to be interactive, allowing two players—the user and the computer—to play against each other. Writing code for a user-friendly interface was one of the most exciting challenges of this project.</p>

    <h2> Copy of Linked List Class </h2>
    <h3> Language: C++, Operating System: Windows, Course: CMPT135 </h3>
    <p>
        I explored the functionality of a singly linked list and implemented my own version in C++ by carefully declaring and defining its member functions. This project involved building the entire linked list class from scratch, ensuring that it mirrored the behavior of the actual data structure. To validate its accuracy, I conducted thorough testing, confirming its functionality and performance against expected standards. This project enhanced my understanding of dynamic data structures and their real-world applications.
    </p>
<br><br><br><br>


    <h2> Testing Sorting Algorithm </h2>
    <h3>Language: C++, Operating System:WSL/Windows / MATLAB ,Tools: Microsoft Excel  Course: CMPT225 Introduction to Data Sructures and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>I conducted an in-depth analysis of various sorting algorithms to evaluate their runtime efficiency under different conditions. As part of this project, I implemented the MergeSort() function in C++ and compared its performance with other algorithms. The results were compiled in Microsoft Excel, where I created detailed graphs to visually represent and compare the algorithms' efficiency. This project honed my skills in algorithm analysis, data visualization, and practical problem-solving.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2> Bug Tracking System</h2>
    <h3> Language: C++, Operating System: WSL/ Windows, Office Tools: Google Suite, Course: CMPT276 Introduction to Software Engineering I </h3>
    <p>This was my first group project, where I collaborated with an incredible team to build a bug tracking system. I took the lead in gathering requirement specifications by engaging with our client, asking insightful questions, and even encouraging them to visualize their needs through drawings. From this, I drafted a comprehensive requirements document that guided the team throughout the project. <br><br>

        I also contributed significantly to the architectural design, creating 2NF and 3NF diagrams, as well as working on detailed interface design and testing. One of my key responsibilities was drafting and continuously updating the user manual whenever changes were made to the software.<br><br>
        
        As the Quality Assurance Tester, I carried out rigorous testing, starting with black-box testing during the initial phase and transitioning to glass-box testing in the second phase. My attention to detail in this area was critical in ensuring the software's functionality.<br><br>
        
        Additionally, I took meeting notes for my teammates whenever they couldn't attend our client meetings, ensuring everyone stayed informed. The most rewarding aspect of this project was working within a team and applying software engineering methodologies such as rapid prototyping, Kanban boards, and the software development lifecycle—my personal favorite being the scrum meetings. <br><br></p>

    <h2>Aakriti Core</h2>
    <h3>Languages: HTML/ CSS, Operating System: Windows, Tools: Canva</h3>
    <p>This project is very close to my heart as it marks the beginning of my journey with web development, which I started in November through FreeCodeCamp. It's my first personal webpage, and I plan to continue working on it, updating and refining it as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. <br><br>

        Currently, I've implemented features like dark mode and light mode, which I crafted using basic HTML and CSS principles. As I grow my skills, I intend to make this website more interactive and engaging by adding new elements and design features.<br><br>
        
        This website is a reflection of my personal growth and creativity, and I am excited to keep developing it over time. Stay tuned for future updates!<br><br>

    <h1> Work Experience </h1>
    <h2> Program Assessment and Development Assistant at SFU </h2>
    <h3> Office Tool: MS Office Suite</h3>
    <p>This is my first job, and I truly enjoy it. My role goes beyond that of a Data Analyst. As part of my responsibilities, I analyze surveys conducted by SFU as part of their welcome packages (e.g., SFU101, UPREP1, UPREP2, and Academic Advising). I create detailed and visually interactive reports for our Vice President and the team. Additionally, I'm involved in testing courses and reporting bugs. I've had the opportunity to collaborate directly with professors, assisting them in testing the courses they've developed.<br><br>

        In addition to my data analysis and testing duties, I also contribute to survey design, helping refine questions and streamline surveys. For instance, I reduced a 40-question survey to just 10 more concise and effective questions. I also worked with the CCR unit to automate data entry, cutting manual tasks by 40%.<br><br>
        
        One of the most fulfilling aspects of my role is acting as a bridge between students and the university, ensuring that student voices are heard and that their feedback is used to improve services. I also co-created a course manual on Accessibility for my colleagues and other SFU staff, which I expanded to include Inclusive and Diverse Education, something I'm especially proud of.<br><br>
        
        As part of my contributions to SFU, I produced an instructional video for the university website, which has since been adopted as an official resource. This job has been a tremendous learning experience for me. I began with no knowledge of Excel, and now it's one of my go-to applications. The people I work with are amazing, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to grow in such a supportive environment.<br><br>

</p>

    <br><br><br><br>
    
    <h2> Volunteer Notetaker</h2>
    <p>In January 2024, I began volunteering as a notetaker for the Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL) at SFU, providing concise and accurate notes for students in the same courses I was taking. This role was deeply meaningful to me, as it allowed me to give back to the community in a way that aligned with my values. I truly believe that we all should help others feel the same support and positivity that we receive in life, which is why I took on this responsibility.<br><br>

        I uploaded my notes to SFU Vault immediately after each lecture to ensure complete anonymity for the students. My notes were always delivered on time, and I highlighted key points and questions emphasized by the professor. <br><br>
        
        Although I initially expected this to be a one-term commitment, I was fortunate to be asked to return in May 2024 for another course. This time, the student I was assisting had a special request for typed notes, so I adapted by typing out my notes in a Word document and sending them directly to the student. I also continued to upload the notes to SFU Vault for easy access. This experience not only allowed me to support my peers but also helped me develop my time management and organizational skills. <br><br></p>
